# `06` Practicing Rules

## üìù Instructions:


1. Set this URL as the background image of the page, and repeat it vertically only:
   [06-background vertical](../../.learn/assets/background-vertical.jpg?raw=true)

2. Change the font-type of the `h1` to `Courier`
   and the rest of the website to `Times new Roman`.

3. Change the color of `h1` to `red`.

4. Make all the `h2s` have an `underline`.

5. Center the `h1` to the middle.

6. Add a `left padding` to the whole document
   of `20px` to make it easier to read.

7. Add a white ***semi-transparent*** background to the **first paragraph** to make it easier to read (see **Hint**). Then apply a `padding` of `5px` to all sides of that paragraph.

8. Change the `anchor` "hover" color to `green` and remove the underline (you have to actually hover the anchor to test it).


## The result should be something like this:

### üí° Hint:

To achieve transparency of your background you need to use the RGBA color model in which the last value (alpha) should be **0.2**. 

The alpha value in RGBA affects the opacity of the color.
