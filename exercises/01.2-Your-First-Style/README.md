# `01.2` Your First Style

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply `CSS rules` to your html elements (i.e. tags), you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it

A CSS rule is a grouping of css proprties that apply to one type of html element.

In the following example, the css rule is the entire code block. It applies to any `<a>` tag, and `color` is just one property in that rule.

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Right now there is a style being applied that is responsible of making the anchor (link) red.
2. Change the style to make your anchor text yellow.
3. Make the font (text) twice its original size - use the `em` units.
