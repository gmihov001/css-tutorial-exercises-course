# `04.1` CSS Shorthand Properties

CSS files take space on your server and also take time to download (like everything). It is yet another text document that the browser has to download before rendering the page. That is why it is important to keep the CSS document as small as possible.

One way to do that is by combining several properties into one such **shorthand property** as with "border":

```css
border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: black;

```

Border properties can be consolidated into a single line as:

```css
border: 5px solid green;

```

# üìù Instructions:


1. Combine the 4 padding properties into just one using the "padding" shorthand property.

2. Combine the all background properties, but the background size, into just one line using the "background:" shorthand.

**Note:**

 The background size cannot be combined, the browsers don't support it yet.\*\*
