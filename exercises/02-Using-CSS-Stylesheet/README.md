# `02` Using CSS Stylesheet

If you use the html `<link>` tag, you can also have your styles on a separate file that we usually call `styles.css`.

That is an even better practice because it lets you have an CSS agnostic website, you can change the CSS later and make the website look 100% different, but still have the same exact HTML.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Observe how the stylesheet is already imported in your `head` tags by using a `<link>` tag.

2. Build the exercise and observe the original look of the page.

3. Fill the `styles.css` with the CSS content needed to:

    a) make the website body blue
    b) give the body top padding of 10vh and left padding of 10vw

4. Build again to observe the differences.     

## 💡Hint:
