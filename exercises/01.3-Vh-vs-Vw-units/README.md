# `01.3` Em vs Rem Units

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply **CSS rules** to your html elements (i.e. tags), you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it.

A `CSS rule` is a grouping of css proprties that apply to one type of html element.

In the following example, the *css* rule is the entire code block. It applies to any `<a>` tag, and `color` is just one *property* in that rule.

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Right now there is a style being applied that is responsible of making the anchor (link) red.
2. Change the style to make your anchor text yellow.
3. Increase the size of the anchor text by putting it in `h2` tags.
4. Give the `body` tag top *padding* of `2vh`, and left *padding* of `2vw`.
