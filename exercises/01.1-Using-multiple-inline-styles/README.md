# `01.1` Using Multiple Inlines Styles

When we work with inline styles, we can apply multiple styles inside the `style` attribute of the html tags, like this:

```HTML
<a href="google.com" style="color: red; font-size: 14px;">Go to google</a>
```

This will set the text color of the link above to red, and the font size to 14 pixels.


## üìù Instructions

1. Within the `index.html` file, copy and paste your html structure from the previous exercise (after it was completed).
2. Make sure that inside of the body you have an `<h1>` tag that reads "HELLO WORLD!!!" with a `style` attribute already applied with value `color: orangered`.
3. Set the style to change the text color of the tag to `purple` and give it a solid red border of 1px. 


### üí° Hint:
 
- Read how to apply borders here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_shorthand.asp
- For this exercise, do NOT use `styles.css` file or `<style>` tag.
