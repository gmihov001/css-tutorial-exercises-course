# `01.4` Change background


As you have seen, this is the code if we want to make all website anchors (`<a> tag's`) blue:

```html
<style>
  a {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Select the `body` by creating a new css rule within the `style` tag.
2. Make the background of your webpage blue by using the `background` property with value `blue`.
2. Build and preview the exercise and your result should be a page with blue background.
