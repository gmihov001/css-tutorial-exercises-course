# `13` Anchor Like Button

Anchors are not only used within blocks of text, but also as a standalone link on the page.  
In such cases it is better to make them look like buttons for a more intuitive and improved UX (*user experience*).

## üìù Instructions:

1. Make the anchor look like a box: Give it a *solid*, *lightgray* border of 1px and set `padding` to `10px`.

2. Rounded borders: Set `border-radius` to `5px`.

3. Set background color to orange. 

4. Remove underline: Set `text-decoration` to `none`.

5. Set the color of the text to `white`.

*To make the button look different when the user hovers over with the mouse, we use the `:hover` selector: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+use+the+hover*

6. Inside of the `:hover` selector, change the background of the button to a darker orange: Bring up the color picker by pointing over the color of the `background` property, find a darker color and apply.

## Expected result:
