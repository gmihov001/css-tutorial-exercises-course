# `01` Using Inline Styles

CSS is about adding styles to our HTML elements. 

The most **basic** way to apply a style to an HTML element is to use the html `style` attribute within the tag. This is called "inline styles" and works like this:

```HTML
<h1 style="color: orangered">HELLO WORLD!!!</h1>
```
In contemporary web design this way of applying styles is **discouraged**, because it is not efficient - you have to apply styles tag by tag. But you will run into examples of it and need to be familiar with it.   

To apply styles you always have to follow th–µse steps:

1. Read the HTML and pick which element you want to decorate, so you can apply CSS to it.
2. Apply the CSS style inline with the `style` attribute as above. 

That is it! The rest is just semantics! üòÅ


## üìù Instructions

1. Within the `index.html` file, create the basic structure of an html page with the appropriate `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
2. Inside of the body of the page, copy and paste the sample code from above.


### üí° Hint:

- A convenient way to import the basic html structure of your web page is to just type an exclamation mark `!` and select the emmet option that will pop up in Gitpod. 
- For this exercise, do NOT use `styles.css` file or `<style>` tag.
