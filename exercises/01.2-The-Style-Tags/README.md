# `01.2` The Style Tags

A more efficient approach to adding styles into your webpages is by writing your CSS in a `<style>` tag, within the `head` tags of your HTML code.

You can have as many style tags as you want but it is recomended to have only one at the beginning of your website code, for better readability.

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            /* the website CSS styles go here */
        </style>    
```

## 📝 Instructions

1. Add a `<style>` tag into your website 
2. Remember that you will need the basic html structure of the web page, including the `head` tags where the `style` tags will go. 
2. Using CSS properties select all `<p>` tags to turn their text color to blue.


### 💡 Hint

- Remember that you will need to complete the html structure of the page, because the `style` tags need to go inside of the `head` tags.
