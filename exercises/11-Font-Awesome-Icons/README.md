# `11` Font Awesome Icons

As a developer/designer, you want to use certain icons to make your website easy to understand; for example, we know that a "trash" icon means "delete".

But using icons can be frustrating and time-consuming because each icon is an image and working with images is horrible!

Font-awesome solves the "image" problem by creating a new set of font-based icons which are easy to import as simple html tags.

To use Font Awesome we need to import a link to it into our html code. We do that by putting a special `<script>` tag in the  `<head>` section of our html page - you can find it in line `6` of the `index.html` of this exercise.  

After linking your website with font-awesome, you can use the following code to insert a specific icon:

```html
<i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>

```
In this case "camera-retro" is the name of the icon and it will paste an icon of a camera in your code (test that by building the exercise).  

You can find all the available icons here: http://fontawesome.io/icons/


## üìù Instructions:

1. Add two more list items into your html list and add a different icon at the beginning of each item.
