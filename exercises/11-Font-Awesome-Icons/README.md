# `11` Font Awesome Icons

As a developer/designer, you want to use certain icons to make your website easy to understand; for example, we know that a "trash" icon means "delete".

But using icons can be frustrating and time-consuming because each icon is an image and working with images is horrible!

Font-awesome solve the "image" problem by creating a new font- each letter is a different icon and you can now import the whole font into your website and use whatever icon you want.

After linking your website with font-awesome, you can use the following code to insert a specific icon:

```html
<i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>
<!-- "camera-retro" will be the name of the icon -->

You can find all the available names here: http://fontawesome.io/icons/
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Add two more items into your list and add a different icon at the beginning of each item.
